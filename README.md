## Description

This is a React App I built to update my knowledge. It's a Covid data tracker that pulls its data from https://disease.sh/. The map also shows different representations for cases, deaths, recovered as well depending on the options selected. This app is built using the newer Functional React Component Syntax as well as React-Hooks for state management. API calls are made using async/await syntax as well. I tried to make a minimal amount of API calls to ensure that the application runs quickly. Data is stored in state and transformed as needed if possible before being passed as props to other components. I also decided to try and learn a new CSS framework Material-UI. Responsiveness was still done from scratch using flexbox, but working with a CSS framework helped me quickly speed up development.

## Technology Used

* `JavaScript`
* `React`
* `React Functional Components`
* `React-Hooks`
* `async/await`

## Lessons Learned

This app was a huge learning experience for me. I really wanted to update my React skills since I haven't touched it in a while since school. Even though I was pretty rusty I felt that picking it up again was much easier this time. The newer Syntax and React-Hooks actually made a lot more sense to me than the old style of React Class Components. Building this app was a big confidence builder for me. Most of the issues I had came from Material-UI  and how to implement it in React.
